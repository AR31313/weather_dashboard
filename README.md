* When User searches for a city, they are presented with current and future Weather conditions for that city.
That city is then added to the search history.

* Users are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

* When Users view the UV index,they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

* Users are also presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

* Users are able to check the city in the search history & will again be presented with current and future conditions for that city

***
    Uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

    Uses `localStorage` to store persistent data.

    Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

    Application user interface style is clean and polished.
